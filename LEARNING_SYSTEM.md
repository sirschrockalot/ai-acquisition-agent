- Tracks success/failure rates, user engagement, and response quality
- Stores metadata like tokens used, response times, and error codes

### 2. **Conversation Context Memory**
- Remembers previous conversations with each user in each channel
- Provides context to OpenAI for more relevant and consistent responses
- Maintains conversation history (last 10 messages per user-channel)

### 3. **User Feedback System**
- Users can provide feedback on bot responses
- Tracks positive/negative feedback with reasons
- Helps identify areas for improvement

### 4. **Learning Analytics**
- Real-time insights into bot performance
- Popular request patterns and user engagement metrics

## 📱 New Commands

### `/learn` - Get Learning Insights
Shows comprehensive analytics about bot performance:
```
🧠 Learning Insights:

📊 Total Interactions: 25
✅ Success Rate: 92.0%
👥 Top Users: @user1 (8), @user2 (5), @user3 (4)
🔥 Popular Requests: 123 Main St (5), 456 Oak Ave (3), 789 Pine Rd (2)

    "channelId": "C123456789",
    "request": "123 Main St, Anytown",
    "response": "Property analysis...",
    "success": true,
    "timestamp": "2025-08-22T17:30:00.000Z",
    "metadata": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "tokens": 150

      "userMessage": "123 Main St, Anytown",
      "botResponse": "Property analysis...",
      "context": "{\"hasAddress\":true,\"addressCount\":1}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔄 How Learning Works

### 1. **Context-Aware Responses**
- Bot remembers previous conversations with each user
- Provides more relevant and consistent responses over time
- Learns user preferences and communication patterns

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**
- Identifies popular request types and successful response patterns
- Tracks which types of requests fail most often
- Suggests improvements based on interaction data

### 3. **Continuous Improvement**
- Feedback system identifies areas for enhancement
- Success rate tracking shows overall performance
- Recommendations guide future development priorities

## 🛠️ Configuration
